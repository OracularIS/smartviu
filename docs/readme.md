### Core Technologies

| Component           | Technology         |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Front-End           | Ext JS 4.2         |
| Server-Side Language| MOCA (LES scripting) |
| Database            | SQL Server or Oracle |


### Security - Role-Based Access Control

Security in SmartViu is managed through role-based access control to ensure secure and controlled access to reports and actions. Each LES command can be mapped to one or more user roles, restricting visibility and execution to authorized personnel only.

By integrating directly with existing Blue Yonder WMS role configurations, SmartViu allows administrators to:

1. Control access to reports
2. Assign or remove roles
3. Keep the system secure without extra setup
